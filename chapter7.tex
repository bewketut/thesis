\chapter{Recommendation, Future Work}
There can be ambitious work that can be done to better this work which include:
• Testing and using another data structure as collision handlers (static ar-
rays for example). This is in line with claims[14] that linked list spoils
the CPU cache behaviour.
• To migrate the code to using RCU (Read Copy Update)[15] mechanism
on the data structure instead of traditional locking we used. This is new
elegant paradigm of synchronization of multiprocessors though patented
by IBM.
And yes, the Author has done some work on the inclusion of IPv6. Part of the code
can be found in the link given the Appendix . In fact, my wish was I complete the
work in protocol independent way. It is fairly easy to infer what protocol has been
used from either Netfilter or raw packet buffer. I discourage the use of protocol-
dependent ’tricks’ unless it is explicitly used for that particular protocol. This is a
simple restatement of the principle of portability
